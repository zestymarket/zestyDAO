# zestyDAO

**Abstract**

ZestyDAO is a collective committed to empowering entrepreneurs and creators with tooling, infrastructure and a community that facilitates sustainable business-building in the metaverse. More specifically, we believe that the intersection of web3 and XR will unlock more value when combined than on their own. XR can borrow from web3 ideas around digital ownership, and XR will help people in web3 develop relationships faster through virtual presence offered by XR hardware.

We believe that the metaverse, as the next evolution of the Internet, should be open and collectively owned by the many. What we are building should thus necessarily reflect that. The formation of a DAO is the best way to express this thinking.

At its core, value creation in the metaverse starts with all that is produced within virtual spaces over time, not excluding into virtual goods and services. This includes builds of architecture in Cryptovoxels, avatar collectibles, and conversations held in Discord. In a virtual world, the more time spent in that space will translate to deeper relationships (if space is social) and development of skills + culture/memes. Value capture happens upon sale of every virtual property or service.

Today, Zesty currently offers two different products:
1. A p2p ad network for rental of banner spaces in the metaverse, with a focus on WebXR properties. It operates autonomously without any servers, but through smart contracts deployed on Polygon. It has so far generated over $5K USDC for WebXR developers and creators around the world.
2. Beacons, which measure the number of times the Zesty Banner SDK has been loaded. Data collected from beacons is shared publicly on IPFS.

We would like to move towards the transition of Zesty and the products that it offers, into a public good.

**Value In The Metaverse**

As the web, which connects everyone in the world, becomes more spatial in nature, the content that people experience will also become more 3D.

To experience these spaces, people will go out to attain headsets that give them full immersion and access to these spaces.

As people spend _time_ in these spaces, they will inevitably become better at certain skills, achieve things and enter social gatherings and experiences with other people.

The time spent in spaces is valuable, and thus the spaces become valuable too due to continued usage of the space, the space attains a level of Lindy effect.

Social experiences allow for relationships to form, which leads or organization and coordination by the participants of the metaverse, which will also lead to creation of companies and DAOs.
